# [smw-wiki.github.io](https://smw-wiki.github.io)

In the future, this will be a wiki dedicated to Super Mario World and its community. We wanted a place to document everything from enemies and game mechanics, to...

- guides/tutorials
- the existence of other smw related resources and websites out there
- related software
- showcasing notable community efforts and projects
- showcasing the community's work when relevant, such as [this patch](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=15168) being noted on the page for chucks

Right now, I don't have the time needed to develop it. This project will eventually exist, though!
