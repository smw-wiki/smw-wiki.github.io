# smw-wiki

Welcome! This is a wiki dedicated to Super Mario World and it's community. We wanted a place to document everything from enemies and game mechanics, to...

- guides/tutorials
- other smw related resources and websites online
- related software
- showcasing the community's work when relevant, such as [this patch](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=15168) being noted on the page for chucks

Right now, the wiki's core code is being developed privately. While being a static site, it will have a fully functional search, integrations with github for history / source view, and something suitable to replace the concept of talk pages.
