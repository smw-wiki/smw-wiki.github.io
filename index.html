  <p>Welcome! This is a wiki dedicated to Super Mario World and it's community. We wanted a place to document everything from enemies and game mechanics, to...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>guides/tutorials</li>
    <li>other smw related resources and sites online</li>
    <li>related software</li>
    <li>showcasing the community's work when relevant, such as <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=15168">this patch</a> being noted on the page for chucks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Right now, the wiki's core code is being developed privately. While being a static site, it will have a fully functional search, integrations with github for history / source view, and something suitable to replace the concept of talk pages.</p>
