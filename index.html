<body>
  <p>In the future, this will be a wiki dedicated to Super Mario World and its community. We wanted a place to document everything from enemies and game mechanics, to...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>guides/tutorials</li>
    <li>the existence of other smw related resources and websites out there</li>
    <li>related software</li>
    <li>showcasing notable community efforts and projects</li>
    <li>showcasing the community's work when relevant, such as <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=15168">this patch</a> being noted on the page for chucks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Right now, I don't have the time needed to develop it. This project will eventually exist, though!</p>
